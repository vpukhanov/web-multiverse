# 🌐 Web Multiverse

Web Multiverse is a fantasy internet simulator that lets you explore alternate versions of the internet - both from different time periods and imaginary universes. Want to browse the internet as it might have existed in ancient Rome? Or perhaps explore what social media would look like in the Star Wars universe? Web Multiverse makes it possible!

## 🚀 Features

- **Universal Browser Interface**: A familiar browser-like experience with URL bar and navigation controls
- **AI-Powered Content**: Every page is uniquely generated using LLMs
- **Alternate History Browsing**: Explore how the internet might have looked in different historical periods
- **Fantasy Web Exploration**: Visit websites from fictional universes and imaginary timelines
- **Retro Web Experience**: Browse nostalgic web pages complete with vintage GIFs, marquees, and period-appropriate styling

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Enter any URL or search query in the browser bar
2. Web Multiverse generates a unique webpage based on your input
3. Experience web content that feels authentic to your chosen universe or time period

## 🛠️ Technical Details

Web Multiverse is built as a single-page application (SPA) featuring:

- A central browser window with authentic browser chrome
- Fully functional URL bar and navigation controls
- Dynamic content container that renders AI-generated HTML
- Scrollable viewport for generated content

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The project aims to recreate the authentic feel of browsing the web, while adding the magical ability to explore alternate versions of internet history. Whether you're feeling nostalgic for Web 1.0 or curious about how social networks might work in a cyberpunk future, Web Multiverse provides a window into these possibilities.
