# Web Multiverse Browser

A whimsical experiment that generates webpages in the style of the 1990s internet. Type in any URL and the browser will generate a unique retro webpage complete with Comic Sans, marquees, and questionable color choices.

## What is this?

It's a fantasy browser that pretends to access webpages from an alternate 1996 where every site is someone's passionate hobby project. Under the hood, it uses AI to generate unique web pages styled with vintage HTML - think animated text, table-based layouts, and plenty of "Under Construction" GIFs.

## How it works

Just type any URL into the browser bar and hit enter. The AI will generate a webpage that feels like an authentic piece of 90s internet history. You might get a restaurant site with a daily specials marquee, a conspiracy theory page in bright red Courier New, or a university department's home page perpetually under construction.
