Imagine an alternate 1996 where every website is someone's passionate hobby:

- Restaurant sites list daily specials in Comic Sans with chef's diary
- Conspiracy sites use red Courier New with "TOP SECRET" watermarks
- University sites have animated construction signs under every page
- All links feel hand-curated - no generic "Click here"
- Colorful backgrounds that make sense for the content and the universe
